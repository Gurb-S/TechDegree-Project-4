# TechDegree-Project-4

This prgram takes an array of object filled with quotes with various information about the quotes 
such as source, citation, year, and tags that apply to the quote.
It takes those quotes and displays 1 of the quotes ranadomly on the screen along with having a random background color.
There is a button that allows you to get a new quote and new background color upon click of button.
The quotes and background color also automaticallly change every 10 secs. 

POSSIBLE ERRORS:
There is no programing errors with the code but there are currently only 5 quotes in the array so it is possible to get
the same quote a few times in a row.


v2  - this has now been fixed and now no quote is shown again until the other ones have been shown

FUTURE PLANS:
The hope is that version 2 will include:

1) a button to stop the interval of the quotes changing (v2 - this button has been added)

2) a button that brings back the last quote that was displayed 


v3 FUTURE PLANS:
The hope is that version 3 will include:


1) ask the user how often they would like a new quote to be displayed

2) a button that restarts a loop once it's been stopped

3) addition to v2 plans of adding button that brings back last quote displayed. making it so the same color is also redisplayed
