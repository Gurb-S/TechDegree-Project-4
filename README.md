# TechDegree-Project-4

This prgram takes an array of object filled with quotes with various information about the quotes 
such as source, citation, year, and tags that apply to the quote.
It takes those quotes and displays 1 of the quotes ranadomly on the screen along with having a random background color.
There is a button that allows you to get a new quote and new background color upon click of button.
The quotes and background color also automaticallly change every 10 secs. 

POSSIBLE ERRORS:
There is no programing errors with the code but there are currently only 5 quotes in the array so it is possible to get
the same quote a few times in a row.


FUTURE PLANS:
The hope is that version 2 will include:

1) a button to stop the interval of the quotes changing

2) a button that brings back the last quote that was displayed
